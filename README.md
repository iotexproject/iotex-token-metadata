# IoTeX Token Metadata
IoTeX Explorer (https://iotexscan.io/) and ioPay wallets (http://iopay.iotex.io/) will include this metadata in their apps. Any IoTeX ecosystem app can include this package in their code (see the **Usage** section below).

We have decided to discontinue the use of this repository for submitting token-related information.

You can follow the new steps below to submit your token metadata:

0. verify your token smart contract here: https://iotexscout.io/verifyContract.
1. Jump to token detail page on IoTeXScan (For example https://iotexscan.io/token/0xb8744ae4032be5e5ef9fab94ee9c3bf38d5d2ae0)
2. Click "Edit Token Info" button on the top right corner of the page
3. Fill in the token metadata and click "Save" button
  

## Guidelines for tokens

- The icon should be small, square, but high resolution, ideally a vector/svg. For png/jpg, 64x64 is recommended.
- No Profanity in token name, description, etc.
