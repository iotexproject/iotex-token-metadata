<!-- Disclaimer
We will only take into consideration projects that show clear signs of activity: 
either traffic on the network, activity on GitHub, or community buzz.
Please notice that maintaining this list is not our highest priority. 
We do not guarantee the inclusion of your project metadata on any urgent timeline,
because maintaining this list is a demanding and security-delicate task. 
We may also decide not to include the submission at all, e.g. if there are no proofs 
for a legit project behind the token, if we suspect the risk of pubm&dump activity, 
airdrop-based phishing, or any cryptocurrency counterfeit scam. 
Plese see the "Guidelines for tokens" section in the README file.
Thanks!
